## Project Background :briefcase:
For every company, a good presentation is the key to achieve their goals. Good presentation is not only related to the ability to persuade the other party. While it is important to have good communication skills, companies around the world also aware that the place where all the parties negotiate also matters. This is the case where **a suitable meeting room is needed**.

Unfortunately, not every company own a meeting room and it was discovered that a lot of companies prefer to rent a meeting room to solve this problem.

According to workinsync.io, **meeting room bookings increased significantly since the end of 2021**. This is largely due to the ending of pandemic. Therefore, less people are working from their home.

This how **EZMeetings** was born, because we understand that it is not easy to find a suitable meeting room for everyone.
